# Web Development Test

## Objectives

Create a feature-rich web application using Next.js and React.js to interact with the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API or any fake API you want. The application should include authentication, commenting, search and filter functionality, pagination, responsive design and testing.

Take a look at this website for a sample UI: https://group.beincom.com/. Create an account and explore our website at your convenience.

## Requirements

1. **Authentication:**
   - Implement a user authentication system with sign-up, login, and logout functionality.
   - Only authenticated users should be able to view the post details.

2. **Commenting System:**
   - Add a commenting feature to the post details page. Authenticated users should be able to leave comments on a post.
   - Display the list of comments for each post.

3. **Search and Filter:**
   - Implement a search functionality on the home page to allow users to search for posts by title or content.
   - Add a filter option to sort posts based on different criteria (e.g., date, number of comments).

4. **Pagination:**
   - If the API supports pagination, implement pagination for the list of posts on the home page.

5. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure that the application is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

6. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for critical components or functions using a testing library of your choice (e.g., Jest).

## Submission

1. Please take no more than 7 days to finish.
2. Create a Git repository for your project and share the repository link with us. Include clear instructions on how to run the application locally and test each of the specified features.
3. The repository should add the following accounts to the repository with the roles of collaborators:
thienna.
4. Contact HR to complete the challenge.

## Evaluation Criterias

Consider the following aspects in your evaluation:

1. Successful implementation of all features.
2. Code quality and adherence to best practices.
3. Security measures in place, especially regarding user authentication.
4. Comprehensive testing strategy and coverage.
5. Thoughtful documentation.
6. Performance optimization techniques used.
7. Utilization of React Query (optional).

We are looking for your programming ability. It must not only work, it should be maintainable.
Advanced technical skills are a plus, but donâ€™t forget that the most important aspect is how you organize the source code for future features.

Feel free to ask for clarification if needed. Good luck!
